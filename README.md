# Scenario 2 - Health Sensing [25 Marks]
You have recently joined a healthcare startup called DeepMedico™ as a data scientist. Your team is working on detecting breathing irregularities that occur during sleep. As part of a pilot study, DeepMedico™ has collected overnight sleep data (8 hours per participant) from 5
subjects. 

For each participant, the following physiological signals are available:
1. Nasal Airflow (sampled at 32 Hz)
2. Thoracic Movement (sampled at 32 Hz)
3. SpO₂ (Oxygen Saturation) (sampled at 4 Hz)
4. In addition to these signals, the dataset also includes:
        - An event file that contains annotations for breathing irregularities (e.g., apnea, hypopnea).
        - A sleep profile file that records sleep stages over time.

Your task is to analyze and model this data to detect abnormal breathing patterns during sleep.
